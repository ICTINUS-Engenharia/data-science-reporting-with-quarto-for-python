To *display* code nicely from other scripts you'll want to use the `include-code-files` extension.

```{.python include="penguins-clustering.py" start-line=1 end-line=14  code-line-numbers="true"}
```

The . prefix is useful for writing code chunks that explicitly will never be *run*.

```{.python code-line-numbers="true"}
2 + 2
2 / 0
```
