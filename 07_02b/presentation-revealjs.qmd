Presentations built with the `revealjs` format don't use Bootstrap so you can't use those SASS variables here.

## Tables in revealjs

```{python}
# | label: tbl-penguins
# | tbl-cap: "The first 10 rows of the Penguins dataset"
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
penguins = load_penguins()
penguins.head(10)
```

## Charts in revealjs

```{python}
# | label: fig-scatter-flip-and-bill
# | fig-cap: "Scatter plot of bill length and flipper length"
# | warning: false
from plotnine import ggplot, geom_point, aes, stat_smooth, facet_wrap
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
(
    ggplot(penguins, aes("bill_length_mm",
           "flipper_length_mm", color="factor(species)"))
    + geom_point()
)
```
