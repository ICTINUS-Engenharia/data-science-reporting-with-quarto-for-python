## Presentations are different

There are additional layouts in `format: revealjs` and these are styled with [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) rather than Bootstrap.

But! Branding still applies!

```{python}
# | output-location: column
# | echo: true
from plotnine import ggplot, geom_point, aes, stat_smooth, facet_wrap
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
penguins = load_penguins()
(
    ggplot(penguins, aes("bill_length_mm",
           "flipper_length_mm", color="factor(species)"))
    + geom_point()
)
```

# Use brand colours {background-color='{{< brand color danger >}}'}
